Cloud Economics and Billing

Some of the fundamentals to pricing consiste of compute, storage and data transfer. 
"AWS data is free" you will only be charge is you transfer data out. 
"AWS allows you to pay for what you use" fun fact as AWS grows you pay less for the service.
AWS has several organizations like AWS management console which helps browser based interface.
Another is AWS Command Line tool it is faster and more convenient than using consule. 
AWS SDK is libabries and sample code like Javascript
AWS Organization HTTPS Query API is a programmatic access that requires credentials. 
So far I've learned to access my bill monitor, usage and analyze control of cost. 
I dont have any questions yet. 
If i do have trouble using AWS cloud i can always use AWS Trust Advisor which is FREE.
